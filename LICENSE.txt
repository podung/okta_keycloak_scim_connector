Notes
This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231
This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.

UnboundID SCIM SDK
Copyright 2011-2013 UnboundID Corp.

The UnboundID SCIM SDK and Reference Implementation are available under three
licenses: the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2, available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), 
the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1, available at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html), 
and a free-right-to-use license created by UnboundID Corp., provided in full below.  You may choose which one you will receive the code under.


UnboundID SCIM SDK Free Use License

THIS IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU ("YOU") AND UNBOUNDID CORP. ("UNBOUNDID") REGARDING YOUR USE OF UNBOUNDID SCIM SDK FOR JAVA AND ANY ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION, OBJECT CODE, COMPILED LIBRARIES, SOURCE CODE AND SOURCE FILES OR OTHER MATERIALS MADE AVAILABLE BY UNBOUNDID (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO IN THIS AGREEMENT AS THE ("SDK").

BY INSTALLING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SDK, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL, ACCESS OR USE THE SDK.

USE OF THE SDK.  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, UnboundID grants to You a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under UnboundID's intellectual property rights in the SDK, to use, reproduce, modify and distribute this release of the SDK; provided that no license is granted herein under any patents that may be infringed by your modifications, derivative works or by other works in which the SDK may be incorporated (collectively, your "Applications").  You may reproduce and redistribute the SDK with your Applications provided that you (i) include this license file, an unmodified copy of the 3RD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt file, and an unmodified copy of the unboundid-scimri.jar file; and (ii) such redistribution is subject to a license whose terms do not conflict with or contradict the terms of this Agreement. You may also reproduce and redistribute the SDK without your Applications provided that you redistribute the SDK complete and unmodified (i.e., with all "read me" files, copyright notices, and other legal notices and terms that UnboundID has included in the SDK).

SCOPE OF LICENSES.  This Agreement does not grant You the right to use any UnboundID intellectual property which is not included as part of the SDK.  The SDK is licensed, not sold.  This Agreement only gives You some rights to use the SDK.  UnboundID reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives You more rights despite this limitation, You may use the SDK only as expressly permitted in this Agreement.

SUPPORT.  UnboundID is not obligated to provide any technical or other support ("Support Services") for the SDK to You under this Agreement. However, if UnboundID chooses to provide any Support Services to You, Your use of such Support Services will be governed by then-current UnboundID support policies.

TERMINATION.  UnboundID reserves the right to discontinue offering the SDK and to modify the SDK at any time in its sole discretion.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, UnboundID may also, in its sole discretion, terminate or suspend access to the SDK to You or any end user at any time.  In addition, if you fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement, then any rights granted herein will be automatically terminated if such failure is not corrected within 30 days of the initial notification of such failure. You acknowledge that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if You breach this Agreement and that UnboundID will be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach.  UnboundID may also terminate this Agreement if the SDK becomes, or in UnboundID's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation.  All rights and licenses granted herein will simultaneously and automatically terminate upon termination of this Agreement for any reason.

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND UNBOUNDID DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL BE ERROR-FREE, VIRUS-FREE, WILL PERFORM IN AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR TIMELY MANNER, OR WILL INTEROPERATE WITH OTHER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SYSTEMS OR DATA.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ALL
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN IF UNBOUNDID HAD BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE), OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL UNBOUNDID OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, COST OF COVER, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND)
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SDK OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF UNBOUNDID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.  Certain states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for certain kinds of damages, so the exclusion of limited warranties and limitation of liability set forth above may not apply to You.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The SDK is subject to United States export control laws. You acknowledge and agree that You are responsible for compliance with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the SDK.

MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement with respect to the SDK.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. This Agreement and performance hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without regard to its conflict of laws rules.  Any disputes related to this Agreement shall be exclusively litigated in the state or federal courts located in Travis County, Texas.
